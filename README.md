### Division of work
Both of us worked on it always at the same time. We had a lot of trouble and had to keep restarting due to random dependency issues so the work was very split. Majd worked on the html and servlets while Yaman did the sql and started off the servlets because Majd was having a lot of trouble with set up in the beginning. Majd worked a little bit more on the actual coding and searching up how to use all these new tools when there were hundreds of errors we were getting. Yaman found Majd's bugs and fixed them within html and a little of the Java. Yaman was the one on the AWS instance making sure that the instance ran properly and connected to our local files. Majd figured out the mysql connection to make it work correctly. We both sat together and worked at the same time so we saw the work and process of each others' tasks and constantly helped each other out. We finally added some small notes to the body tag to add a little valentines theme to the website. We both agree that we equally contributed to this project. Hope you enjoy the final product!
