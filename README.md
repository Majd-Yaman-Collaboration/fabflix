# CS 122B Project 1 

### Both of us worked on it always at the same time. We had a lot of trouble and had to keep restarting due to random dependency issues so the work was very split. Majd worked on the html and servlets while Yaman started off the servlets because Majd was having a lot of trouble with set up in the beginning. Since Majd did work a little bit more on the actual coding and searching up how to use all these new tools when there were hundreds of errors we were getting, Yaman focused on the AWS instance making sure that the instance ran properly and connected to our local files. We both sat together and worked at the same time so we saw the work and process of each others' tasks. We finally added some small notes to the body tag to add a little valentines theme to the website. We both agree that we equally contributed to this project. Hope you enjoy the final product!

# CS 122B Project 2

# CS 122B Project 3

### Yaman did all of task 6 and Task 1. Majd did all of Task 4. Majd did all of task 5 except the Employee Login Page. Task 3 was worked on before so really both of us. Task 2 was both of us too.

## prepared statements in files:
- CheckoutSerlvet
- ConfirmationSerlvet
- LoginInterface
- casts124
- mains243
- MovieListServlet
- SingleStarServlet
- SingleMovieServlet

Optimizations:
- using .addBatch()
- using a % to batch only 500 hundered at a time -> using less massive chunks of memory
- Added an index for title and director since they were sort of the "primary key" used to identify a movie from the useful data in casts124.
- Turned off foreign_key_checks when inserting because I knew it was safe to do so.
